\frametitle{Initial choices}

Assume a collective-pitch helicopter

- Fixed-pitch helicopters are less exciting ;)

Need to select brand

- All my own "real" helicopters are from Align or are Align clones
- Assuming we are starting from a kit

Need to select power source

- Fueled helicopter (Nitro, gas)

- Electric helicopter (Battery)

Need to select type of stabilization

- Flybarred helicopter (mechanical stabilization)

- Flybarless helicopter (electronic stabilization)

Need to select electronic components

\end{frame}

\frametitle{Electronic components}

Electronics

- Several brands available for each type of component

- Radio equipment: transmitter, receiver

-- Typically 2.4 GHz
-- Two major brands: Spektrum and Futaba

- If electric, a speed controller (ESC)

-- Amperage

- Servos

-- 3 servos to control the rotor head (main blade pitch)

-- 1 servo to control the tail blade pitch

-- If fueled, 1 servo to control the throttle
