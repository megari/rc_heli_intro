\frametitle{Initial choices}

Assume a collective-pitch helicopter
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fixed-pitch helicopters are boring ;)
\end{itemize}

Need to select brand: Align, GAUI, Mikado, a clone
\begin{itemize}
	\item All my own "real" helicopters are from Align or are Align clones
	\item Assuming we are starting from a kit
\end{itemize}

Need to select power source
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fueled helicopter (Nitro, gas)
	\item Electric helicopter (LiPo Battery)
\end{itemize}

Need to select type of stabilization
\begin{itemize}
	\item Flybarred helicopter (mechanical stabilization)
	\item Flybarless helicopter (electronic stabilization)
\end{itemize}

Need to select electronics

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frametitle{Electronics}

Several brands available for each type of component

Radio equipment: transmitter, receiver
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typically in the 2.4 GHz band
	\item Two major brands: Spektrum and Futaba
\end{itemize}

If electric, a speed controller (ESC)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Voltage and amperage
\end{itemize}

Motor (electric) or engine (fueled)
\begin{itemize}
	\item KV rating should match helicopter size
\end{itemize}

Servos
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3 servos to control the rotor head via swashplate (main blade pitch)
	\item 1 servo to control the tail blade pitch
	\item If fueled, 1 servo to control the throttle
\end{itemize}

Gyro
\begin{itemize}
	\item Must be compatible with servos
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Control}

A collective-pitch helicopter needs 6 channels for full control:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3 channels for rotation around the 3 axes
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Forward--backward (pitch)
		\item Left--right (roll)
		\item Rudder left--right (yaw)
	\end{itemize}
	\item 3 channels for other things
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Throttle
		\item Collective pitch
		\item Gyro gain
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
