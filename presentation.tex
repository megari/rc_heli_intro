\frametitle{Initial choices}

Assume a collective-pitch helicopter
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fixed-pitch helicopters are boring ;)
\end{itemize}

Need to select brand
\begin{itemize}
	\item All my own "real" helicopters are from Align or are Align clones
	\item Assuming we are starting from a kit
\end{itemize}

Need to select power source
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fueled helicopter (Nitro, gas)
	\item Electric helicopter (LiPo Battery)
\end{itemize}

Need to select type of stabilization
\begin{itemize}
	\item Flybarred helicopter (mechanical stabilization)
	\item Flybarless helicopter (electronic stabilization)
\end{itemize}

Need to select electronics

\frametitle{Electronics}

Several brands available for each type of component

Radio equipment: transmitter, receiver
\begin{itemize}
	\item Typically 2.4 GHz
	\item Two major brands: Spektrum and Futaba
\end{itemize}

If electric, a speed controller (ESC)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Voltage
	\item Amperage
\end{itemize}

Servos
\begin{itemize}
	\item 3 servos to control the rotor head (main blade pitch)
	\item 1 servo to control the tail blade pitch
	\item If fueled, 1 servo to control the throttle
\end{itemize}
